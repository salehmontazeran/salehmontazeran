### M. Saleh Montazeran üëã

As a highly skilled Machine Learning Engineer with a Master's degree in AI and experience in designing, implementing and deploying machine learning models, I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects in a variety of applications with a focus on deep learning techniques. My proficiency in Python and Pytorch, along with my strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and computer vision, allows me to develop and implement models that can analyze complex data sets and extract meaningful insights. I have experience in working on real-world projects such as; machine learning model for deforestation detection in Argentina, mapping and estimating the area of farmed lands of wheat and predicting wheat phenological stages. Furthermore, I am experienced in deploying models in production Linux servers and have a strong ability to work independently, manage time effectively, and deliver projects on schedule. Additionally, I have experience in back-end development and have architected the base software infrastructure for multiple organizations.
